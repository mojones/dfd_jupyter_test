## About Me

I'm a freelance trainer specialising in teaching Python with a strong focus on data analysis and exploration. I trained as a biologist and completed my PhD in large-scale phylogenetics in 2007, then held a number of academic positions at the University of Edinburgh ending in a two year stint as Lecturer in Bioinformatics. I've been teaching and writing freelance full-time since 2015.
