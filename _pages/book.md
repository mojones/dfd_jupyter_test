## Time to get to grips with your data

#### With Python, pandas and seaborn in your toolbox, you too can develop data exploration superpowers.
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


We're currently in a **golden age of data**. It's never been easier to assemble large datasets to probe questions in almost any field.  

But these large datasets come with their own problems:

- How to clean and validate data?

- How to combine datasets from multiple sources?

- And how to look for patterns in large, complex datasets and display your findings?

**These are the questions that we all ask when we start working with these rich data sources.**

The solution to these problems comes in the form of Python's scientific software stack. The combination of a friendly, expressive language and high quality packages makes a fantastic set of tools for data exploration.

But the packages themselves can be **hard to get to grips with**. It's difficult to know where to get started, or which sets of tools will be most useful.

You may have already encountered this. If you look at the matplotlib website, it's clear that it's a powerful charting tool - but looking at the tutorial can be daunting. The same goes for pandas: it can carry out almost any type of data manipulation, but that same power makes it hard to get to grips with.

Happily, learning to use Python effectively for data exploration is **a superpower that you can learn**. With a basic knowledge of Python, pandas (for data manipulation) and seaborn (for data visualization) you'll be able to understand complex datasets quickly and mine them for insight.

You'll be able to make **beautiful, informative charts** for posters, papers and presentations, and rapidly update them to reflect new data or test new hypotheses.

And you'll be able to quickly make sense of datasets from other projects - millions of rows of data will no longer be a scary prospect!

In this book, I have drawn on years of teaching experience to give you the tools you need to answer your data exploration questions. Starting with the basics, you'll learn how to use Python, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib effectively using real world examples throughout.

### **Just the best bits** <br/>of the best data exploration packages

Rather than overwhelm you with information, the book concentrates on the most useful parts of the relevant libraries. Full color illustrations show hundreds of examples covering dozens of different chart types, with complete code samples that you can tweak and use for your own work.

**The book is designed to help you get over the most common obstacles that we encounter with real world data.**

You'll learn what to do if:

- your input files have errors, or missing data.

- your input files are too big to fit in memory

- you need to combine data from multiple sources

- you have to visualize datasets with thousands of rows or millions of columns

- you need to make complex filters for your data

- your data are in the wrong format for the analysis you want to do


Once you understand the basics of pandas, seaborn and matplotlib, the chapters on visualization will show you how to make sophisticated charts with minimal code and how to best use color to make clear charts.

### **All the chart types** you'll need

The book covers the most basic charts that we use every day - histograms, scatter plots and boxplots - and more exotic charts like clustermaps and violin plots - all with full working code and real world examples.

For getting started with data exploration in Python, the step-by-step approach offered by the book beats everything else. But the real power of Python's data processing stack becomes apparent when you combine the individual tools in a single project.

**That's where the videos come in.**

In each of the four detailed videos, we'll take a single real world dataset and walk through all the steps involved in analyzing it, starting with publicly available data files and ending with our final figures. The videos give us a chance to explore different **types of data**, demonstrate **tips and techniques** that don't fit in the book, and use visualization to answer **interesting questions** on wide-ranging topics.

### **Video 1: 5000 Movie dataset**

#### In this video we look at a dataset of 5000 movies with genres, dates and budgets
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<br/>
In it you'll learn:

- how to clean crowd-sourced data
- how to spot artefacts caused by human error
- how to deal with structured data inside columns
- how to quickly spot correlations between columns
- how to view trends over time

### **Video 2: Car accident reports**

#### In this video we explore reports of 3.5 million US car accidents
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<br/>
In it you'll learn:

- how to reduce memory usage of large files
- what to look out for when dealing with automated data collection
- how to use heatmaps for visualizing temporal data
- how to use GeoPandas to deal with geographic data
- how to visualize geographical data at multiple levels of detail
