    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that makes data exploration such a powerful skill to have is the ease with which we can find interesting datasets online. We can search for data that will help us to answer real world questions, or just browse for interesting collections of data (that's how I picked all the example datasets for the videos that accompany the [Drawing from Data book](https://drawingfromdata.com/book/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "One downside, however, of finding existing datasets to work with is that we have no control over the format of the data. When we hit the download button on a new dataset we might find all sorts of things that will make our analysis difficult. Some of these I've already written about - invalid data, missing data, data spread over multiple files or with obvious errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more subtle problem is when the data are not in the structure that we would like. This issue is bit more complex than the others. If a dataset has annotation errors then we could all agree that that is bad. But the specific way that a data file is structured isn't good or bad in itself - it's just that a given structure makes some problems easy and some problems hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, pandas has very powerful tools for reshaping and restructuring data. In this article we'll try to answer a problem that is difficult given the structure of our data file, but becomes very easy when we reshape the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As always, to keep this article to a reasonable size we won't be going in to too much detail on the methods involved. All of the methods we'll use here are covered in detail in the [Drawing from Data book](https://drawingfromdata.com/book/). In particular, check out chapter 3 for a discussion of calculations on series and chapter 14 for the reshaping tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in more articles and tips on data exploration with Python, you should subscribe to the [Drawing from Data newsletter](https://drawingfromdata.com/newsletter/) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DataDrawing).\n",

    "Our starting point for this analysis is a data file giving the highest and lowest mean daily temperature in Farenheit for each year for a bunch of different cities. Let's take a look at it:"

    "\n",
    "In this article we have looked at two different approaches to solving a difficult data analysis problem in pandas. If we had to describe them at a high level, we might say that the first way is to write code to solve the difficult problem. The second is to write code to reshape the data so that the difficult problem becomes an easy problem, then solve the easy problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, this can be a very powerful problem-solving technique when working with datasets. The key is the imagination step: given a data analysis question, imagine what data structure would make that question easy to answer. Like any aspect of programming, this becomes easier with practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience teaching data exploration with Python, the reshaping tools are the parts of pandas that are most under-used. Partly this is because they can be tricky to understand, but partly it's a matter of mindset. It can be difficult to remember that the format of a dataset when we recieve it is not set in stone; it's simply how it happens to be stored at that time. And one of the big differences I notice between novice and experienced programmers is a willingness to rearrange the data to suit the question at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "So next time you are faced with a tricky data analysis problem, try this strategy. Before starting to write code, try to think of a structure for the data that would make the problem easier, and see if you can get your data into  that form. \n",
