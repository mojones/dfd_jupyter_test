    "I've been teaching quite a lot of Pandas recently, and a lot of the recurring questions are about grouping. That's no surprise, as it's one of the most flexible features of Pandas. However, that flexibility also makes it sometimes confusing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: For a much more detailed explanation of grouping operations, checkout the chapter on working with groups in the [*Drawing from Data* book](https://drawingfromdata.com/book/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that most of the confusion arises because the same grouping logic is used for (at least) three distinct operations in Pandas. In the order that we normally learn them, these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- calculating some aggregate measurement for each group (size, mean, etc.)\n",
    "- filtering the rows on a property of the group they belong to\n",
    "- calculating a new value for each row based on a property of the group. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads commonly to situations where we know that we need to use `groupby()` - and may even be able to easily figure out what the arguments to `groupby()` should be - but are unsure about what to do next. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a trick that I've found useful when teaching these ideas: think about the result you want, and work back from there. If you want to get a single value for each group, use `aggregate()` (or one of its shortcuts). If you want to get a subset of the original rows, use `filter()`. And if you want to get a new value for each original row, use `transpose()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a minimal example of the three different situations, all of which require exactly the same call to `groupby()` but which do different things with the result. We'll use the well known `tips` dataset which we can load directly from the web:"
