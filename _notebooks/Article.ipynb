    "### Executive summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching from 64 bit to 32 bit precision for floating point data in pandas saves memory and has virtually no effect on the data, as long as the values aren't greater than around 10<sup>300</sup> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Slightly longer summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- I wrote code to download ~1,000 real world datasets from kaggle and look at summary statistics and linear regressions of floating point columns in both 64 and 32 bit precision\n",
    "- The final analysis involved ~1,000 datasets, ~8,000 data files, ~500,000,000 individual floating point values and ~500,000 linear regressions. \n",
    "- Changing to 32 bit precision introduced a mean proportional error of around 10<sup>-8</sup> in the summary statistics, with the worst affected columns having a proportional error of around 10<sup>-6</sup>\n",
    "- For linear regressions, the mean proportional change in slope and intercept was on the order of 10<sup>-6</sup>\n",
    "- A small number of outliers with near-zero slope (representing uninteresting relationships) had larger proportional errors\n",
    "- In ~400,000 valid linear regressions I was unable to find any relationships whose significance at the 5% level was changed by moving from 64 to 32 bit precision\n",
    "- For real world datasets, switching from 64 to 32 bit floating point precision is overwhelmingly unlikely to alter our conclusions about the data, and is an easy way to reduce memory usage. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've probably noticed, this is a longish article, so grab a cup of coffee if you're planning to read it all. If you're already familiar with floating point precision and error in pandas you can probably skip part one. Most of the methods stuff is in part two, so if you just want to see the results, skip to part three. Also, just to head off the obvious criticism, I think that most of the conclusions of this article could have been arrived at by pure reasoning, without looking at any data at all. But hopefully some folks will, like me, be more satisfied by empirical data :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, I think that pandas is wonderful :-) But it has a number of quirks, among them a reputation for being memory hungry. There are no shortage of articles online discussing how to fit large dataframes in memory, and there are a number of well established techniques (there's a whole chapter on the subject in the [Drawing from Data book](https://drawingfromdata.com/book/), and also an extended discussion in the car accidents dataset video). \n",
    "\n",
    "One technique that always gets mentioned is storing numbers in a reduced precision data type. This is usually proposed as one of the last things to try after other options have been exhausted. I think there are a couple of reasons for this. One is that messing about with data types is a bit harder to explain than simple things like ignoring unneeded columns. Another is that deliberately throwing away information - which is what reducing precision will do - feels very uncomfortable from a data analysis point of view!\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that I've rarely seen in such discussions is a measurement of how much of an effect reduced precision will have in real life datasets. This is surprising, since pandas makes it very easy to measure. So let's go ahead and try it...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part one: changing data types and measuring differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, a quick reminder of the pandas tools we'll use. All of the methods etc. are described in detail in the [Drawing from Data book](https://drawingfromdata.com/book/), so we'll limit ourselves here to an overview. \n",
    "\n",

It contains real world data from a massive range of different fields and sources, mostly stored in files that will be easy to get in to pandas.
